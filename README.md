# React + TypeScript + ESBuild Chrome Extension Template

This is a starter template for building a Chrome extension with React and TypeScript. The
build system is [ESBuild](https://esbuild.github.io/).

## Usage

Run `yarn watch` to run the project in watch mode. Whenever a file in `public` or `src` changes,
the project will be built to the `dist` folder.

Now, you can load the `dist` folder as an unpacked extension in Chrome.
